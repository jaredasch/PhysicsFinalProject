## Gameplay
Players spawn in the world filled with electric charges and another player. Each player is trying to fire a postive charge at the other player. The path of the proton will be affected by the various charges in the space surrounding the player. Each player starts with 100 HP, and each time they are hit with a projectile, they sustain damage proportional to the velocity of the projectile squared. The goal of the game is to "kill" your opponent, by lowering their HP to 0.

## Physics Concepts Implemented
- Electric Fields (direction shown by arrow, strength indicated by opacity)
- Electrical forces impact the trajectory and movement of the projectile charges
- The damage done by the projectile is proportional to the kinetic energy of the projectile at impact
